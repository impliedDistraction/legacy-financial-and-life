## Testing Your Setup

1. **Without API Keys (Basic Mode):**
   - Map shows basic Google Maps embed
   - All navigation buttons work
   - Venue information displays correctly

2. **With Google Maps API Key:**

## Cost Information

### Google Maps API:
- **Free tier:** 28,000 map loads per month
- **Cost:** $7 per 1,000 additional map loads
- **Recommended for:** Most small to medium businesses

### MapBox:
- **Free tier:** 50,000 map loads per month
- **Cost:** $0.50 per 1,000 additional map loads
- **Recommended for:** Higher traffic sites or custom styling needs

## Troubleshooting

### Map Not Loading:
1. Check that your API key is correctly set in environment variables
2. Verify the API key has the correct APIs enabled
3. Check domain restrictions match your site URL
4. Look for console errors in browser developer tools

### Navigation Links Not Working:
- Navigation links work without API keys
- Check that the address format is correct
- Test links manually by copying URLs

### Development vs Production:
- Environment variables need to be set in both environments
- Use different API keys for development and production if needed
- Test thoroughly before deploying to production

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify API keys are properly configured
3. Test with the basic setup first (no API keys)
4. Contact your development team for technical support

## Security Notes

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Restrict API keys to your specific domains
- Monitor API usage to prevent unexpected charges
- Consider using different keys for development and production
