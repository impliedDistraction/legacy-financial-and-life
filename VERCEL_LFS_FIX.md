# Vercel Git LFS Configuration Fix

**DEPRECATED**: This LFS configuration was attempted but ultimately replaced with direct git storage. See `LFS_TO_GIT_MIGRATION.md` for the final solution.

## Status: Replaced with Direct Git Storage

While this LFS configuration worked locally and was technically correct, it continued to cause deployment issues on Vercel. The repository has been migrated to store images directly in git without LFS to ensure reliable deployments.

For the current image storage approach, see:
- `LFS_TO_GIT_MIGRATION.md` - Details of the migration and current setup
- `.gitattributes` - Updated to remove LFS tracking
- `package.json` - Simplified without LFS scripts
- `vercel.json` - Simplified without LFS configuration

This document explains the fix for the image loading issue on Vercel deployment where images work locally but fail to load on the deployed site.

## Problem

Images stored in Git LFS (Large File Storage) were not being properly fetched during Vercel deployment, resulting in:
- Images loading correctly in local development
- Zero images loading on Vercel deployment
- Build succeeding but serving LFS pointer files instead of actual images

## Root Cause

Vercel's build process wasn't configured to fetch Git LFS objects before building the site. This meant that:
1. The repository was cloned with LFS pointer files (small text files) instead of actual images
2. These pointer files were copied to the built site
3. Browsers received text files instead of images when requesting image URLs

## Solution

### 1. Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)

Added Git LFS support to Vercel configuration:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "lfs": true
  }
}
```

This tells Vercel to fetch LFS objects during the deployment process.

### 2. Enhanced LFS Script (`scripts/ensure-lfs.sh`)

Improved the prebuild script to:
- Verify that images are properly checked out (not LFS pointers)
- Provide detailed logging for debugging
- Support both system-installed and portable Git LFS
- Exit with error codes if LFS checkout fails

Key improvements:
- Added verification step that checks if image files are still LFS pointers
- Counts and reports the number of images vs pointer files
- Provides clear error messages for troubleshooting

### 3. Build Process Improvements (`package.json`)

Updated the prebuild script to be more informative:
```json
"prebuild": "bash scripts/ensure-lfs.sh || sh scripts/ensure-lfs.sh || echo 'LFS checkout failed, but continuing with build'"
```

This provides clearer error messages while still allowing the build to continue.

## Verification

The fix ensures that:
1. ✅ All LFS objects are fetched before building
2. ✅ Images are verified to be actual binary files, not pointers
3. ✅ Build process fails clearly if LFS checkout fails
4. ✅ All images are properly copied to the `dist/` directory

## Testing

To test the fix locally:

```bash
# Clean LFS cache to simulate fresh deployment
git lfs fetch --all
git lfs checkout

# Run the enhanced LFS script
bash scripts/ensure-lfs.sh

# Build and verify images
npm run build
file dist/images/logo.png  # Should show actual image file, not text
```

## Deployment

Once these changes are deployed to Vercel:
1. Vercel will automatically fetch LFS objects due to `"git": {"lfs": true}`
2. The prebuild script will verify all images are properly checked out
3. The build will include actual image files in the deployed site
4. Users will see images loading correctly

## Troubleshooting

If images still don't load after deployment:

1. Check Vercel build logs for LFS-related errors
2. Verify that the `[ensure-lfs]` output shows "0 are still LFS pointers"
3. Ensure the Vercel project has access to the Git repository's LFS storage
4. Check that LFS bandwidth/storage quotas aren't exceeded

## Future Considerations

- Monitor LFS bandwidth usage on the Git provider
- Consider optimizing image sizes to reduce LFS storage costs
- Implement image CDN if needed for better performance
