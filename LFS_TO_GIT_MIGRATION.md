# Migration from Git LFS to Regular Git Storage

This document explains the migration from Git LFS to regular git storage for images to resolve Vercel deployment issues.

## Background

The repository previously used Git LFS (Large File Storage) to store image assets. While this worked well for local development, it caused persistent issues with Vercel deployments where images would fail to load despite having comprehensive LFS configuration.

## Issues with LFS on Vercel

1. **Image Loading Failures**: Images worked locally but failed to appear on Vercel deployments
2. **LFS Quota/Bandwidth**: 55+ LFS-tracked files caused potential bandwidth limit issues
3. **Build Complexity**: Required complex prebuild scripts and LFS configuration
4. **Deployment Reliability**: Inconsistent behavior across different deployment platforms

## Migration Solution

### What Changed

1. **Removed LFS Tracking**: Updated `.gitattributes` to remove LFS filters for image files
2. **Converted to Regular Git**: Migrated all LFS-tracked images to regular git storage
3. **Simplified Build Process**: Removed LFS-related scripts and configuration
4. **Updated Vercel Config**: Removed `"git": {"lfs": true}` from `vercel.json`

### Files Modified

- `.gitattributes` - Removed LFS tracking configuration
- `package.json` - Removed `prebuild` and `postinstall` LFS scripts
- `vercel.json` - Removed LFS configuration
- All image files - Converted from LFS pointers to regular git files

### Benefits

1. **Reliable Vercel Deployments**: Images now deploy consistently without LFS dependencies
2. **Simplified Build Process**: No more complex LFS checkout scripts
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Standard git workflow without LFS complications
4. **Better Performance**: No LFS bandwidth limits or authentication issues

## Image Storage Details

- **Total Size**: ~12MB for all images (reasonable for git storage)
- **File Count**: 55+ image files including responsive variants
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, WEBP, ICO files stored directly in git
- **Location**: `public/images/` and `public/` directories

## Build Process

The build process is now simplified:

```bash
npm ci        # Standard npm install (no LFS setup)
npm run build # Direct Astro build (no prebuild LFS step)
```

## Deployment

Vercel deployments now work with standard git checkout:

1. Vercel clones the repository with regular git
2. All image files are immediately available as actual binary files
3. Build process copies images to `dist/` directory
4. Images load correctly on the deployed site

## Future Considerations

- **Image Optimization**: Consider implementing automated image optimization
- **CDN Integration**: For better performance, consider moving to a CDN if needed
- **Size Monitoring**: Monitor git repository size as more images are added
- **Backup Strategy**: Ensure images are backed up appropriately

## Verification

To verify the migration worked:

```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# Check that images are real files, not LFS pointers
file public/images/logo.png
file dist/images/logo.png

# Both should show actual image data, not LFS pointer text
```

This migration resolves the "Still no images on vercel deploy" issue by eliminating LFS dependency entirely.
