# Image Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
The website was experiencing 404 errors for missing image files that were referenced in the site configuration but didn't exist in the `/public/images/` directory.

## Files Affected
- `/images/logo.svg` - Company logo (referenced in header)
- `/images/team-photo.jpg` - Tim & Beth Byrd professional photo (referenced in hero and team sections)

## Temporary Fix Applied
To resolve the 404 errors immediately, placeholder images have been created:
- `public/images/logo.svg` - Copy of existing favicon.svg
- `public/images/team-photo.jpg` - Copy of existing og-image.jpg

## Permanent Solution Needed
According to the issue description, the actual images were "uploaded through a comment" on GitHub. To complete the branding setup:

### Step 1: Replace Placeholder Images
1. Download the actual images from the GitHub issue comment where they were uploaded
2. Replace the placeholder files:
   - `public/images/logo.svg` with the real Legacy Financial & Life logo
   - `public/images/team-photo.jpg` with the real Tim & Beth Byrd professional photo

### Step 2: Verify Image Quality
- Ensure logo is optimized for web (SVG preferred, or high-quality PNG)
- Ensure team photo is professional quality and web-optimized
- Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### Step 3: Test Website
- Run `npm run dev` and verify images display correctly
- Check console for any remaining 404 errors
- Test the site on mobile and desktop

## Status
‚úÖ **404 errors resolved** - No more console errors
‚ö†Ô∏è **Placeholder images in use** - Real images still needed
üìã **Action required** - Replace placeholders with actual brand assets
